2.7 Takeaways
-------------

* Real thinking is enabled by abstractions (new functions and classes).
* Bottom-up development lets functions reveal themselves as actions are repeated with different parameters.
* Top-down development is closely tied to the problem domain. This is where you get your most expressive APIs.
* An LLM can help here by explaining ontologies.
* Going a level down is necessary to understand what your code is really doing.
* An LLM can help explain what is behind an implementation, its complexity, its memory use, and logical dependencies.
* That leaves you to think through the implications.
* Sometimes the easiest way to detect quadratic code is to increase the scale of the dataset and observe how much time is takes.
* Learn to move back and forth between the three levels.
* Let your data and your code take you mind to new places.
* Don't forget to have fun.
